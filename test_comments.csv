Dear god this site is horrible
 Somebody will invariably try to add Religion  Really  You mean the way people have invariably kept adding Religion to the Samuel Beckett infobox  And why do you bother bringing up the longdead completely nonexistent Influences issue  Youre just flailing making up crap on the fly   For comparison the only explicit acknowledgement in the entire Amos Oz article that he is personally Jewish is in the categories     
  It says it right there that it IS a type The Type of institution is needed in this case because there are three levels of SUNY schools  University Centers and Doctoral Granting Institutions  State Colleges  Community Colleges  It is needed in this case to clarify that UB is a SUNY Center It says it even in Binghamton University University at Albany State University of New York and Stony Brook University Stop trying to say its not because I am totally right in this case

 Reason for banning throwing   This article needs a section on why throwing is banned At the moment to a noncricket fan it seems kind of arbitrary

If Ollie or others think that one list of the oldest people we know about is too long the easy answer is to raise the cutoff age 110 is purely a round number and a full 12 years shorter then the record We can make it the top 1000 or top 500 or everyone above 115  tell us what the maximum list size is and we can set a threshold

  Not sure whether this is notable enough to be mentioned in the article but youre right â€“ versions later than 6 2001 can open files created by all previous versions but save files only in its own format with a suffix of msX where X is the version number 7 8 9 10 11 12 This is intentional of course Besides all versions but 7 save files in a compressed format â˜­å…±äº§ä¸»ä¹‰ä¸‡å²â˜…

  balance  This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word and a huge amount about the slangprofane uses Perhaps the former should be extended is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name This is an encyclopaedia not a dictionary     i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipediaIMMEDIATLY this word is used very often and is also a very mean word i belive that is majorly true very much so okay so the good meaning is a female dog  BITCH It also stands for the name Brittany Fellowsâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢     etymology  The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning female of the dog of unknown origin Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja But OED notes that the converse is equally possible  The adj Bitchy was first seen in 1925   The verb meaning to complain in 1930  Slang Bitchen good is attested to the 1950s   reclaiming the word bitch   The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English In most other English variants bitch maintains its correct definition  female canine People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult  but so is pig dog cow and others These are not considered profane so why is bitch As far as I am concerned there is nothing to reclaim as bitch simply means a female canine  It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor  that does not make it a profanity      It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women reclaiming the word bitch in the 90s Can anyone point to articles on this etc The song is definitely interesting and belongs here but doesnt actually reclaim the word bitch any more than it reclaims the word sinner  Also I dont really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up but I realized I dont know what it means Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches fertility and patriarchy more clearly   We dont need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples even outside of the 90s Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word for instance Shes a Bitch    References are fine  just the name Missy Elliot got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned reclaiming the word In fact if some one knows more about her it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to womenslurs more generally within hiphop    How relevant is this reclamation It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits I dont see how using a word connoting querolous spiteful and malicious can be empowering But I dont know lifes a bitch    It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesnt adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch To use a literary example in the novel The Handmaids Tale the narrator related the feeling that whenever she outsmarted a man she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind even her own husband     That literary reaction you recited is jealousy men have names for other men who outsmart them too but not having a word like bitch for them they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets Though you havent been specific I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination which both sexes often strive to impose on the other but men have traditionally had more power Because it is such a popular epithet in slang the connotations of bitch are diffuse though still commonly pernicious I think bitch in itself is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard but rather a contemptuous word often used for it  However I still dont see the point of reclamati

  Im not convinced that he was blind Where is this documented Its possible that he was just what wed call Legally blind ie didnt have great vision and that the name Blind Blake is an exaggerated moniker Although I have no proof Ive got a feeling that him being legally blind is more likely than totally blind Of course Ive got no evidence to back that thing up
   Ref SS Ponzi Scheme   Hi Padillah  It is not my opinion that I am trying to impose here although it may appear to be so I am just highlighting the fact that it remains controversial whether it is or isnt a Ponzi Scheme even if a legal one so you cannot state as a fact that it is not a Ponzi Scheme I saw the reference and the perpetrator itself cannot be treated as a reliable source In fact claiming it is not a Ponzi Scheme seems to be an opinion in itself My point is that a claim should not be made either way and the edit in question just accomplishes that   Thank you  Virat

Id never think Id need to say it but Wikipedia isnt a fansite discussion board If anything is unannounced by any authority it might as well be false MMORPGs are overrated
But this is not the article about government position but about the reaction Add positions to 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence or Foreign relations of Kosovo

I agree with Billfruge The author describes the unverifiable nature of the two competing etymology theories sufficiently well so as not to mislead any reader renders an opinion as to which of the two is more likely and it is clear that this is the authors opinion and presents the reader with the opportunity to accept either or neither of the two
