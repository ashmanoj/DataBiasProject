   Ref SS Ponzi Scheme   Hi Padillah  It is not my opinion that I am trying to impose here although it may appear to be so I am just highlighting the fact that it remains controversial whether it is or isnt a Ponzi Scheme even if a legal one so you cannot state as a fact that it is not a Ponzi Scheme I saw the reference and the perpetrator itself cannot be treated as a reliable source In fact claiming it is not a Ponzi Scheme seems to be an opinion in itself My point is that a claim should not be made either way and the edit in question just accomplishes that   Thank you  Virat,no

  balance  This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word and a huge amount about the slangprofane uses Perhaps the former should be extended is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name This is an encyclopaedia not a dictionary     i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipediaIMMEDIATLY this word is used very often and is also a very mean word i belive that is majorly true very much so okay so the good meaning is a female dog  BITCH It also stands for the name Brittany Fellowsâ€”Preceding unsigned comment added by   â€¢     etymology  The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning female of the dog of unknown origin Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja But OED notes that the converse is equally possible  The adj Bitchy was first seen in 1925   The verb meaning to complain in 1930  Slang Bitchen good is attested to the 1950s   reclaiming the word bitch   The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English In most other English variants bitch maintains its correct definition  female canine People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult  but so is pig dog cow and others These are not considered profane so why is bitch As far as I am concerned there is nothing to reclaim as bitch simply means a female canine  It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor  that does not make it a profanity      It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women reclaiming the word bitch in the 90s Can anyone point to articles on this etc The song is definitely interesting and belongs here but doesnt actually reclaim the word bitch any more than it reclaims the word sinner  Also I dont really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up but I realized I dont know what it means Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches fertility and patriarchy more clearly   We dont need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples even outside of the 90s Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word for instance Shes a Bitch    References are fine  just the name Missy Elliot got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned reclaiming the word In fact if some one knows more about her it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to womenslurs more generally within hiphop    How relevant is this reclamation It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits I dont see how using a word connoting querolous spiteful and malicious can be empowering But I dont know lifes a bitch    It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesnt adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch To use a literary example in the novel The Handmaids Tale the narrator related the feeling that whenever she outsmarted a man she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind even her own husband     That literary reaction you recited is jealousy men have names for other men who outsmart them too but not having a word like bitch for them they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets Though you havent been specific I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination which both sexes often strive to impose on the other but men have traditionally had more power Because it is such a popular epithet in slang the connotations of bitch are diffuse though still commonly pernicious I think bitch in itself is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard but rather a contemptuous word often used for it  However I still dont see the point of reclamati,no
  Firstly still making undiffable edits and refusing to use edit summaries is becoming a behavioural issue that will need to be escalated if it doesnt stop Gun I really dont understand why you find it so hard to follow the basic standards of behaviour required to edit in a collaborative environment  Secondly announcing changes on someones talk page doesnt really count as discussing them collaboratively rather it means you discussed it with me  Furthermore I told you to go to the NPOV noticeboard to raise the State University vs University issue if you wanted to discuss the issue which you a failed to do b you removed the disputed tag from the article without a result as I suggested waiting until later c you made yet another diff which contained a large number of other unknown unknowable and undisucssed changes to the article    ,no
  Im not convinced that he was blind Where is this documented Its possible that he was just what wed call Legally blind ie didnt have great vision and that the name Blind Blake is an exaggerated moniker Although I have no proof Ive got a feeling that him being legally blind is more likely than totally blind Of course Ive got no evidence to back that thing up,no
  It says it right there that it IS a type The Type of institution is needed in this case because there are three levels of SUNY schools  University Centers and Doctoral Granting Institutions  State Colleges  Community Colleges  It is needed in this case to clarify that UB is a SUNY Center It says it even in Binghamton University University at Albany State University of New York and Stony Brook University Stop trying to say its not because I am totally right in this case,no
  Name in the introductory paragraph  Ive always been told that using Dr  PhD in the same name was incorrect as the PhD automatically conferred the status of doctor   However Im not sure what to do in this case  Since he is so wellknown as Dr Martin Luther King Jr the normal approach of dropping Dr and keeping PhD doesnt seem to be the best answer even though its the one most style guides seem to endorse  Would someone more intimately familliar with the article like to take a swing at changing it or suggesting an alternative   ,no
  Not sure whether this is notable enough to be mentioned in the article but youre right â€“ versions later than 6 2001 can open files created by all previous versions but save files only in its own format with a suffix of msX where X is the version number 7 8 9 10 11 12 This is intentional of course Besides all versions but 7 save files in a compressed format â˜­å…±äº§ä¸»ä¹‰ä¸‡å²â˜… ,no
  So on the tenth anniversary of 911 New York Times columnist Paul Krugman delivered the odious piece of dribble ever on the attack  well at least since the last time he wrote about it The headline is quote The Years of Shame end quote And no its not directed at radical Islam Instead he targets America and the quote fake heroes Krugman claims that the atrocity has been hijacked The sick word given that hes not actually talking about the real hijackers who killed some 3000 Americans No hes referring to people like George Bush and Rudy Giuliani who he thinks capitalized on the horrible crimes But the worst part at the end of this column the creep writes Im not going to allow comments on the post for obvious reasons That obvious reason hes a coward I mean why else would you ban responses Hes like a 10yearold boy crankcalling all of us only to hang up even before he hears a response hearing his shame for his own wickedness Now I watch the memorial services and I feel sorrow for the families whose grief never really ends But since Im lousy at emotional reflection I usually avoid it But at least I can summarize what many feel today in nine words go to hell Paul Krugman you bearded bitter buffoon,yes

 Mrpainkiller Neurophyte and JeanPhilippe   After a complaint at intervention against vandalism I protected the article VampireFreakscom  It was either that or block all of you for disruption and personal attacks  I will unprotect the article in the morning  In the meantime please consider the following  Reverting another users talk page is pretty rude  There is a policy conflict between the user talk page policy which says users can blank or archive warnings although archiving is preferred by the community and the vandalism policy which says that removing warnings given to you is vandalism  I dont agree with the vandalism point of view and I havent seen a lot of support for it lately except among people who are fighting amongst themselves for other reasons  If someone deletes a warning theyve obviously seen it  If you are concerned about someones edits use a verbose edit summary so that even if the warning is removed the edit summary will be visible  I understand there is a view among two of you that Mrpainkiller7s edits are detrimental to the article  There are lots of right ways to deal with this including editing by consensus Request for comment on the article or the user Mediation and third opinion  Im not going to judge the content but fighting wherever it occurs is the wrong way to deal with the problem  Personal attacks are not to be tolerated  Please deal with the content of edits not character   Im leaving this message with each of you  If you keep fighting over talk pages I suppose I or another admin will eventually figure its time to block someone  Unless you are positive that you are 100 right and the other guy is 100 wrong you should probably try and work this out peacefully in case the admins dont see things your way,no
